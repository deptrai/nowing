### Missing Requirements Analysis

#### 🔴 Critical Gap: Intelligence Layer Not Explicitly Mapped

**[FR-INT-01] Natural Language Queries**
- **PRD Requirement:** User asks "Show me trending Solana memes with >$10k liquidity created in the last hour" → System translates to DexScreener API filters + SQL Query
- **Epic Coverage:** ❌ NOT FOUND as explicit story
- **Impact:** **HIGH** - This is a core differentiator ("AI Moat")
- **Current State:** Functionality may be embedded in FR-EXT-02 (AI Chat Interface) but not explicitly called out
- **Recommendation:** 
  - **Option A:** Add Story 1.7 or 2.4: "Natural Language Query Engine"
  - **Option B:** Clarify in Epic 1 Story 1.2 that AI Chat includes NL query translation
  - **Preferred:** Option B (less scope creep) + add acceptance criteria to Story 1.2

**[FR-INT-02] Basic Rug Pull Detection**
- **PRD Requirement:** User asks "Is $TOKEN safe?" → System checks LP lock, holders %, mint authority
- **Epic Coverage:** ✅ Covered in Epic 2, Story 2.3 (Rug Pull Early Warning System)
- **Status:** ✓ RESOLVED

**[FR-INT-03] Smart Alerts**
- **PRD Requirement:** System pushes notifications for anomalies, not just price thresholds
- **Epic Coverage:** ✅ Covered in Epic 2, Story 2.1 (Real-time Price Alerts)
- **Status:** ✓ RESOLVED

#### ⚠️ Medium Gap: Data Layer Integration Not Explicit

**[FR-DAT-01] DexScreener Integration**
- **PRD Requirement:** Real-time Price, Volume, Liquidity, FDV, Pair Age for Solana/Base/Ethereum
- **Epic Coverage:** ⚠️ IMPLICIT - Mentioned in Epic 1 dependencies, used in Story 1.4
- **Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Foundation for all features
- **Current State:** Assumed as infrastructure, not a deliverable story
- **Recommendation:** 
  - **Option A:** Add Story 0.1: "DexScreener API Integration" to Epic 1
  - **Option B:** Document as "Technical Dependency" in Epic 1 with acceptance criteria
  - **Preferred:** Option B (infrastructure, not user-facing)

**[FR-DAT-02] DefiLlama Integration**
- **PRD Requirement:** TVL metrics for "Macro Context" queries
- **Epic Coverage:** ⚠️ IMPLICIT - Mentioned in Epic 2/3 dependencies
- **Impact:** **LOW** - Nice-to-have for Phase 2+
- **Current State:** Assumed as future integration
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Defer to Phase 2 or 3
  - Add as "Future Enhancement" in Epic 3
  - **Status:** ACCEPTABLE for MVP

### Additional Findings

#### ✅ Positive: Authentication Added

- **FR-EXT-00** (Authentication System) was added to Epic 1 as Story 1.0
- **Status:** P0 BLOCKER correctly identified and addressed
- **Coverage:** OAuth login, JWT management, session handling
- **Recommendation:** ✓ APPROVED

#### ✅ Positive: Comprehensive Extension Coverage

- All 17 Extension FRs (FR-EXT-01 through FR-EXT-17) are explicitly mapped
- Clear phase breakdown (Phase 1-4)
- Each story has detailed acceptance criteria
- **Status:** ✓ EXCELLENT COVERAGE

#### ⚠️ Concern: Web Dashboard FRs

- FR-UI-01, FR-UI-02, FR-UI-03 marked as "Existing Feature"
- **Question:** Are these already implemented or planned?
- **Recommendation:** Clarify status in Epic 1 or create Epic 0 for "Existing Infrastructure"

### Coverage Validation Summary

#### Strengths ✅

1. **Excellent Extension Coverage:** 18/18 Extension FRs explicitly mapped (100%)
2. **Authentication Added:** P0 blocker addressed with Story 1.0
3. **Clear Traceability:** Each story references specific FR codes
4. **Phased Approach:** Logical progression from Core → Monitoring → Intelligence → Productivity

#### Gaps ⚠️

1. **Intelligence Layer Unclear:** FR-INT-01 (NL Queries) not explicitly mapped
   - **Risk:** Core differentiator may not be implemented
   - **Mitigation:** Clarify in Story 1.2 acceptance criteria

2. **Data Layer Implicit:** FR-DAT-01/02 assumed as infrastructure
   - **Risk:** Integration complexity underestimated
   - **Mitigation:** Document as technical dependencies with DoD

3. **Web Dashboard Status Unclear:** FR-UI-01/02/03 marked "Existing"
   - **Risk:** Assumptions about existing features may be wrong
   - **Mitigation:** Verify implementation status

### Recommendations

#### Priority 1: Clarify Intelligence Layer (P0)

**Action:** Update Epic 1, Story 1.2 (AI Chat Interface) to explicitly include:
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Natural Language Query Translation (FR-INT-01)
  - User can ask: "Show me trending Solana memes with >$10k liquidity"
  - System translates to DexScreener API filters
  - Results displayed in chat with context
```

#### Priority 2: Document Data Layer Dependencies (P1)

**Action:** Add to Epic 1 "Technical Dependencies" section:
```markdown
### Data Layer Integration (FR-DAT-01, FR-DAT-02)

**DexScreener API:**
- Real-time price/volume/liquidity data
- Support: Solana, Base, Ethereum
- Rate limit compliance: 300 req/min
- **DoD:** API client library with error handling

**DefiLlama API (Phase 2+):**
- TVL metrics for macro context
- Deferred to Epic 2/3
```

#### Priority 3: Verify Web Dashboard Status (P2)

**Action:** Audit existing codebase to confirm:
- FR-UI-01: Chat Management → Implemented? Where?
- FR-UI-02: Settings → Implemented? Where?
- FR-UI-03: Analytics → Implemented? Where?

If not implemented, create Epic 0 or add to Epic 1.

   - Keyboard shortcut overlay (`Cmd+Shift+S`)

**Impact:** This is a **user-facing application** with extensive UI requirements across:
- Chrome Extension (Plasmo/React)
- Web Dashboard (Next.js)
- Mobile-responsive design implied

### Alignment Issues

#### 🔴 Critical Gap: No UX Design Document

**Issue:** PRD defines 20 functional requirements with UI components, but there is NO:
- Wireframes or mockups
- User journey flows
- Component library specification
- Design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Accessibility guidelines
- Responsive breakpoints

**Risk:** **HIGH**
- Developers will make ad-hoc UI decisions
- Inconsistent user experience across features
- Potential rework if design doesn't match user expectations
- No validation of user flows before implementation

**Recommendation:** **P0 - BLOCKER for Epic 1 Implementation**
- Create UX Design document BEFORE starting Story 1.1 (Side Panel Architecture)
- Minimum required:
  1. **Wireframes:** Side Panel layout, Chat Interface, Token Info Card
  2. **User Flows:** Login → Chat → Quick Capture → Settings Sync
  3. **Component Specs:** Button styles, input fields, card layouts
  4. **Design Tokens:** Color palette, typography scale, spacing system

#### ⚠️ Medium Gap: Architecture Doesn't Address UX Performance

**Issue:** Architecture documents (backend, web, extension, integration) focus on data flow and APIs, but don't address:
- **UI Performance:** How to handle real-time price updates without UI jank?
- **Offline UX:** What happens when WebSocket disconnects?
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens? Spinners? Progressive loading?
- **Error States:** How to display API errors to users?

**Risk:** **MEDIUM**
- Poor user experience during network issues
- Janky UI during high-frequency updates
- Confusing error messages

**Recommendation:** **P1 - Address in Epic 1 Architecture Notes**
- Add "UX Performance Considerations" section to `architecture-extension.md`
- Define:
  - Loading state patterns (skeleton screens for chat, token cards)
  - Error handling UI (toast notifications, inline errors)
  - Offline mode UX (cached data display, sync indicators)
  - Real-time update throttling (debounce price updates to 1s intervals)

#### ⚠️ Low Gap: No Accessibility Standards

**Issue:** PRD mentions keyboard shortcuts (FR-EXT-17) but no:
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- ARIA labels
- Color contrast requirements

**Risk:** **LOW** (for MVP, but important for production)
- Extension may not be accessible to users with disabilities
- Potential Chrome Web Store rejection

**Recommendation:** **P2 - Add to Epic 4 or Future Enhancements**
- Document accessibility requirements in UX Design doc
- Add ARIA labels to acceptance criteria for UI stories
- Test with screen readers before Chrome Web Store submission

### Warnings

#### ⚠️ Warning 1: UX Document Missing for User-Facing Application

**Severity:** **HIGH**

**Details:**
- Nowing 2.0 is a **user-facing Chrome Extension** with 17 Extension FRs requiring UI
- PRD describes UI elements (Side Panel, Chat, Token Cards) but no visual designs
- No user journey validation before implementation

**Mitigation Required:**
- **BEFORE Epic 1 Implementation:** Create UX Design document
- **Minimum Deliverables:**
  - Wireframes for Side Panel, Chat Interface, Token Info Card
  - User flow: Login → Chat → Quick Capture → Settings Sync
  - Component library (buttons, inputs, cards, modals)
  - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

**Responsible Party:** UX Designer or Product Manager
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks before Epic 1 Story 1.1 starts

#### ⚠️ Warning 2: Architecture Gaps for UX Requirements

**Severity:** **MEDIUM**

**Details:**
- Architecture documents don't address:
  - Real-time UI updates (WebSocket → React state → UI)
  - Loading/error states
  - Offline mode UX
  - Performance optimization for high-frequency updates

**Mitigation Required:**
- Update `architecture-extension.md` with "UX Performance Considerations"
- Define loading state patterns, error handling UI, offline mode UX
- Add to Epic 1 Technical Dependencies

**Responsible Party:** Architect (Winston) + Lead Developer
**Timeline:** Before Epic 1 Story 1.2 (AI Chat Interface)

#### ⚠️ Warning 3: No Design System Defined

**Severity:** **MEDIUM**

**Details:**
- No color palette, typography scale, spacing system defined
- Risk of inconsistent UI across 17 Extension features
- Developers will make ad-hoc design decisions

**Mitigation Required:**
- Define design system in UX Design document
- Use existing Nowing 1.0 design tokens if available
- OR create new design system for 2.0 rebrand

**Responsible Party:** UX Designer
**Timeline:** Before Epic 1 Story 1.1 starts

### UX Alignment Summary

#### Status: ⚠️ **UX DOCUMENT MISSING - HIGH PRIORITY GAP**

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ **UX is clearly implied** in PRD (20 FRs with UI components)
2. ❌ **No UX Design document** exists (wireframes, flows, design system)
3. ⚠️ **Architecture doesn't address UX performance** (loading states, errors, offline mode)
4. ⚠️ **No accessibility standards** defined

---

## Step 5: Epic Quality Review - COMPLETE ✅

### Review Methodology

Validated all 4 epics and 13 stories against BMAD `create-epics-and-stories` best practices:
- ✅ User value focus (not technical milestones)
- ✅ Epic independence (no forward dependencies)
- ✅ Story sizing and completeness
- ✅ Acceptance criteria quality
- ✅ Database/entity creation timing
- ✅ Dependency analysis

---

### Epic 1: Extension Core Infrastructure

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Stories:** 7 (Story 1.0 - 1.6)  
**FRs Covered:** FR-EXT-00, FR-EXT-01, FR-EXT-02, FR-EXT-03, FR-EXT-04, FR-EXT-05, FR-EXT-06

#### 🔴 Critical Violation: Technical Epic Title

**Issue:** Epic title "Extension Core Infrastructure" is a **TECHNICAL MILESTONE**, not user-centric.

**Best Practice Violation:**
- ❌ "Infrastructure" = technical term, no user value
- ❌ Title describes WHAT we build, not WHAT users can do
- ❌ Sounds like "Setup Database" or "Create Models"

**Impact:** **HIGH**
- Developers focus on tech, not user outcomes
- Product managers can't communicate value to stakeholders
- Epic doesn't pass "so what?" test

**Remediation:**
- **Option A:** Rename to "AI-Powered Crypto Assistant in Browser"
  - User value: "Chat with AI about crypto"
  - Outcome-focused: "Get instant token insights"
- **Option B:** Rename to "Smart Crypto Browsing Experience"
  - User value: "Browse DexScreener with AI co-pilot"
  - Outcome-focused: "Never miss important token info"
- **Preferred:** Option A (clearer value proposition)

**Justification for Current Title:**
- Epic 1 IS foundational infrastructure
- BUT: Users don't care about "infrastructure"
- Users care about: "Can I chat with AI?" "Can I save pages?" "Does it sync?"
- **Recommendation:** Rename to focus on user capabilities

#### ✅ Positive: Excellent Story Structure

**Strengths:**
1. **Story 1.0 (Authentication):** Correctly identified as P0 BLOCKER
   - Clear user value: "Login to sync settings and chat history"
   - Independent: Can be completed without other stories
   - Comprehensive ACs: OAuth, JWT, offline handling

2. **Story Independence:** All stories can be completed independently
   - Story 1.1 (Side Panel): Standalone architecture
   - Story 1.2 (AI Chat): Uses Story 1.1 output, doesn't require future stories
   - Story 1.3 (Context Detection): Independent feature
   - Story 1.4 (DexScreener Integration): Uses Story 1.3 output
   - Story 1.5 (Quick Capture): Independent feature
   - Story 1.6 (Settings Sync): Uses Story 1.0 (Auth)

3. **No Forward Dependencies:** ✅ VERIFIED
   - No "depends on Story 1.X" found
   - No "requires Epic 2" found
   - Epic 2 references are only in "Recommendations" section (acceptable)

#### ⚠️ Major Issue: Missing Given/When/Then Format

**Issue:** Acceptance Criteria are checklist-style, not BDD format.

**Example from Story 1.0:**
```markdown
- [ ] Login flow trong extension:
  - "Login" button trong side panel header
  - Click → Open OAuth popup
```

**Best Practice:**
```markdown
**Given** user is not logged in
**When** user clicks "Login" button in side panel header
**Then** OAuth popup opens with Google and Email/Password options
**And** user is redirected back to extension after successful login
```

**Impact:** **MEDIUM**
- Harder to write automated tests
- Ambiguous expected outcomes
- Missing error scenarios

**Remediation:**
- Convert all ACs to Given/When/Then format
- Add error scenarios (e.g., "Given OAuth fails, Then show error message")
- **Timeline:** Before Story 1.1 implementation

---

### Epic 2: Smart Monitoring & Alerts

**Status:** 📋 PLANNED  
**Stories:** 3 (Story 2.1 - 2.3)

#### ✅ Positive: User-Centric Epic Title

**Title:** "Smart Monitoring & Alerts"
- ✅ User value: "Get alerts for price movements and risks"
- ✅ Outcome-focused: "Don't miss opportunities or lose money"
- ✅ Passes "so what?" test

#### ✅ Positive: Epic Independence

**Validation:**
- Epic 2 uses Epic 1 outputs (Side Panel, Auth, Settings Sync)
- Epic 2 does NOT require Epic 3 or Epic 4
- All stories are independently completable
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

#### ⚠️ Major Issue: Vague Acceptance Criteria

**Issue:** Story 2.3 (Rug Pull Early Warning) has vague ACs.

**Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Rug pull detection algorithm:
  - Check LP lock status
  - Analyze holder distribution
  - Monitor liquidity changes
```

**Problem:**
- What threshold triggers a rug pull alert?
- How is "suspicious" defined?
- What's the false positive rate target?

**Best Practice:**
```markdown
**Given** token has <50% LP locked for <7 days
**And** top 10 holders own >60% of supply
**And** liquidity decreased >30% in 1 hour
**When** system runs rug pull detection
**Then** alert is triggered with "HIGH RISK" label
**And** notification shows specific risk factors
```

**Remediation:**
- Add specific thresholds to all detection algorithms
- Define "suspicious" with measurable criteria
- **Timeline:** Before Story 2.3 implementation

---

### Epic 3: Trading Intelligence

- Consider splitting if implementation takes >5 days
- **Timeline:** Review during Epic 4 planning

---

### Cross-Epic Dependency Analysis

#### ✅ No Forward Dependencies Found

**Validation Results:**
- Searched all epic files for "depends on", "requires Story", "needs Epic"
- **Result:** ❌ NO FORWARD DEPENDENCIES FOUND
- All dependencies are backward (Epic N uses Epic N-1 outputs)

**Dependency Chain:**
```
Epic 1 (Foundation)
  ↓
Epic 2 (uses Epic 1: Side Panel, Auth, Settings Sync)
  ↓
Epic 3 (uses Epic 1: Side Panel, Auth + Epic 2: Watchlist)
  ↓
Epic 4 (uses Epic 1: Side Panel, Auth)
```

**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Proper dependency hierarchy

---

### Database/Entity Creation Timing

#### ✅ Proper Entity Creation Pattern

**Validation:**
- Story 1.0 (Auth): Creates `users`, `sessions` tables
