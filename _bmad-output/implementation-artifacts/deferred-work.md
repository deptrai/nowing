# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 3-14-memory-injection-bounded-retrieval (2026-08-05)

- **Finding:** Over-materialization of candidates in `search.py` — `top_k*3` bounded materialization is acceptable for current corpus sizes.
  - **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `3-14-memory-injection-bounded-retrieval.md`.
  - **Reason / when to revisit:** Revisit if corpus grows beyond ~1M rows or if p95 memory pressure becomes measurable in AC-3 latency evidence.

- **Finding:** RRF ranking tie-break tests are missing exhaustive coverage.
  - **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `3-14-memory-injection-bounded-retrieval.md`.
  - **Reason / when to revisit:** Add dedicated tie-break tests once AC-3 p95 latency is stable and the search ordering contract is frozen.

- **Finding:** `_is_templated` does not detect Jinja control-flow tags (`{% ... %}`).
  - **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `3-14-memory-injection-bounded-retrieval.md`.
  - **Reason / when to revisit:** Current automation templates use value placeholders only; upgrade when control-flow templates are used in production.

- **Finding:** D10 / D5 non-automation scope matrix not addressed in chunk B.
  - **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `3-14-memory-injection-bounded-retrieval.md`.
  - **Reason / when to revisit:** Covered by spec and route/MCP tests; revisit if a new non-automation surface is added.

## Deferred from: code review of 8-12-workspace-limits (2026-08-04)

- **Finding:** Storage sum does not reconcile deleted backend files — `workspace_limits.py:199-209`.
- **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `8-12-workspace-limits.md`.
- **Reason / when to revisit:** `sum_storage_bytes` sums `DocumentFile.size_bytes` from DB rows. If a storage backend file is deleted without deleting the `DocumentFile` row (or vice versa), the metric drifts. Storage limits are soft/exploratory in Story 8.12. Revisit when storage enforcement is implemented.

- **Finding:** Disable/enable Invite member and Upload affordances based on limits — `workspace-limits-manager.tsx`.
- **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `8-12-workspace-limits.md`.
- **Reason / when to revisit:** The backend is the source of truth for limit enforcement. The settings limits page is visibility/upgrade only. UI affordance gating in the team/invite and document upload flows is a defense-in-depth UX improvement that should be picked up when the product wants to reduce failed-action feedback loops for plan-limited workspaces.

## Deferred from: code review of story 11.1

- **Finding:** Concurrent `PATCH /users/me/notification-preferences` updates can lose keys because `_merge_notification_preferences` reads the user row, merges in memory, and overwrites the whole JSONB column.
- **Action:** Marked `[x] [Review][Defer]` in `11-1-telegram-notification-foundation.md`.
- **Reason / when to revisit:** Resolving this correctly requires either `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on the user row or an optimistic lock on `updated_at` so overlapping patches merge against the latest value atomically. This is a real correctness issue but is out of scope for the foundation story; it should be picked up when notification preferences expand beyond a single top-level key or when the endpoint is exposed to higher concurrency (e.g., user-facing automation toggles from multiple devices).

## Deferred from: code review of 10-1-batdongsan-scraper (2026-08-03) — RESOLVED

- **Finding:** `ScrapeOutput.cost_micros` is set to 0 for degraded runs in `batdongsan.scrape/executor.py`, but `charge_capability` in `app/capabilities/core/billing.py` still debited the wallet via `_charge_platform_meter` when `output.billable_units > 0`, creating a mismatch between displayed cost and actual charge.
- **Action taken (2026-08-03):** Updated `_charge_platform_meter` in `app/capabilities/core/billing.py` to detect `output.degraded`, record a 0-cost `TokenUsage` audit row, and skip `service.charge`. This fix is cross-platform and applies to `batdongsan`, `muaban_bds`, and `chotot` platform scrapers.
- **Verification:** `ruff check app/capabilities/core/billing.py` ✅ / `pytest tests/unit/capabilities/test_billing.py -q` ✅ 63 passed / `pytest tests/unit/capabilities/batdongsan ...` ✅ 44 passed.
